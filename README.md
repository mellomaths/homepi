# HomePi

My Home Server using Raspberry Pi 5. Download this repository to your Raspberry Pi and run the commands to connect to your Pi.

## Connect to HomePi

Connect to HomePi from your local network. In the [connect.sh](connect.sh) script I defined variables for user and host to connect to my HomePi, you can change them if needed.

```bash
just connect
# this will execute ./connect.sh
```

You can see other commands in the [Justfile](Justfile).
